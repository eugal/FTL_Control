FTL_Controller 
===========

This is a controller for the game FTL: Faster than Light by Justin Ma and Matthew Davis. 
The arduino code is heavily based on an example for shift registers. There is also an 
image of the arduino circuit made in Fritzing, and images of the physical controller while it was operating.
